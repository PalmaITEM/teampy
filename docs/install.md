# Installation


## Installing Python

Teampy only requires that you have [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org) installed.
Make sure that you let the installer add the Python command line tools to your path,
so that you can later execute the pip command and the other commands that Teampy comes with.


## Installing Teampy

After Python is installed, you can install Teampy via pip on the command line:

    pip install teampy

To upgrade, use:

    pip install --upgrade teampy

Pip will install several command line tools. If your command line does not recognize
the pip command, make sure the Python installer added them to the path.

To check which version of teampy you have, use

    teampy --version


## Other Tools

Teampy creates LaTeX files, from which you can create PDF files for printing.
If you haven't used it, [see here how to install LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).
