# Teampy: Tools for Team-Based Learning

This is a set of Python scripts to manage readiness assurance tests for
team-based learning. Teampy helps you to manage *paper-based* readiness assurance tests (RATs).

* Write your RAT in a simple textual format, in any text editor of your choice.
* Convert the raw RATs into LaTeX, from which you can generate PDF.
* Teampy shuffles the questions and answers for each student, so that cheating is a bit harder.
* Collect the answers by writing a single line of text for each student.
* Look at the results of a class to give feedback to students.
* Send individual results to each student via your own email.


## Current Project Status

The project is in an early stage, and not all features are in place yet.


## For Developers

* Teampy is open source. You can [browse the source code on Github](https://github.com/falkr/teampy),
