# Teampy: Tools for Team-Based Learning

This is a set of Python scripts to manage readiness assurance tests for
team-based learning. Teampy helps you to manage *paper-based* readiness assurance tests (RATs).

For the creation of RATs, Teampy helps you with the following:

* **Write your RAT in a simple textual format.** This lets you work in the editor of your choice. In this source format, you write questions so that always the first answer alternative is the best (correct) one. 
* Convert the raw RATs into LaTeX, from which you can generate PDF.
* **Teampy shuffles the questions and answers for each student and each team.** This makes cheating a bit harder, since students cannot just copy the answer alternatives from their neighbors. It also lets you select the scratch cards for the teams without reshuffling your question alternatives manually.**
* All students receive an individual answer sheet with their name already filled out. <span class="minor">This gives you better control over who attends the RATs, and prevents students from taking them home when RATs count for final grades.</span>

For the grading, Teampy helps you with the following:

* **Collect the answers by writing a single line of text for each student.** <span class="minor">This makes correcting the RATs surprisingly fast. For most classes, you get the results from the individual round already before the team round is finished.</span>
* **Look at the results of a class to give feedback to students.** <span class="minor">This helps you to detect concepts and questions that need some clarification.</span>
* Send individual results to each student via your own email.
